                    <p>
                        In this module, I have had quite an extensive experience in learning the basics of web development: coding, design, and the debugging process. While initially HTML and CSS seemed easy to me, further into layout techniques and styling difficult designs, a variety of challenges were thrown at me. The most eye-opening was debugging; sometimes small syntax errors could change the way code laid out and functioned. Having said that, this process has really taught me about the importance of attention to detail and iterative problem-solving.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It helped me to appreciate the complication in web design and development. I will be better prepared when starting new projects, reusing tools such as development tools, and following the best coding standards. From structuring HTML semantically to styling elements in CSS, this journey has been both challenging and rewarding, and for that, I am grateful for the skills I have gained in building responsive and aesthetically pleasing websites. Defining structures for the website using html was very easy and not tediuos but errors in css were very hard to solve as properties of multiple elements conflicted.

                    <h3 class="report-h3">Site Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the term, I developed the site little by little both technically and in its design. First of all, I started with the basic structure in HTML, with some CSS just to get an idea of what I was building and what I needed to do next to enhance the design and functionality of the site. After that, I then gave full attention to CSS in order to build a user-friendly website.

                    <p>             
                        To make it more intuitive, I'd adopted the philosophy of minimal design: simple color palette and readable fonts. It helped to keep the layout clean and the user experience nice; navigation between pages was easy. Later on, I worked on enhancing the layout with Flexbox and added responsive design to make it look good on different screen sizes.

                    <h3 class="report-h3">Design Decisions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Regarding the design, I chose the colors by trying several to see which was more attractive and suitable for the design I had in my mind. Based on the look, I chose the fonts. I looked online for good fonts to use, and then I found "system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji"". I liked this font because this font has a very non-serious attractive style that fits the website and its contents very well. Regarding colors, I chose mainly three colors. They are White, rgb(17, 24, 39), and #3be8b0.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I chose these three colors because of the contrast they give when used together. With the white background and the darker rgb(17, 24, 39) color, it is very easy to give contrast, and the #3be8b0 color gives perfect highlight to key elements on the page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not only colors but I have used multiple font sizes and font-weight for different elements to give them a separated look, which makes for a very appealing design. Big font size for titles and small for paragraphs, while for links, it's medium.

                    <h3 class="report-h3">Validation of Site</h3>
                    <p>
                        In order to ensure the site was valid, I ran each HTML and CSS file through W3C validation tools. The process proved enlightening, as the  errors and warnings were often things that I could change. Screenshots of these validation reports are atached here showing that the HTML and CSS files have no errors and are standards compliant.
