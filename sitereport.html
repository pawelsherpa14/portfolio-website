                    <p>
                        Throughout this module, I've had a comprehensive experience learning the basics of web development, including coding, design, and the debugging process. Initially, I found HTML and CSS straightforward, but as I delved into layout techniques and styling difficult designs, I encountered various challenges. Debugging was particularly eye-opening, as I realized that small syntax errors could significantly impact the layout and functionality. This process taught me the importance of attention to detail and iterative problem-solving.

                        This project helped me appreciate the complexities of web design and development, and I feel more confident using development tools and adhering to coding standards. From structuring HTML semantically to styling elements in CSS, this journey has been both challenging and rewarding, and I am grateful for the skills I've gained in creating responsive and visually appealing websites.

                    <h3 class="report-h3">Development of the Site</h3>
                    <p>
                        Over the term, I progressively developed the site, focusing on both technical and design aspects. Initially, I started by building the core structure using HTML with some css to get the idea of what I was building and what I should do next to improve the design and functinoality of the site. After this I focused fully in CSS to build a User-Friendly website.

                        To ensure an intuitive user interface (UI), I followed a minimalist design approach, using a simple color palette and readable fonts. This helped maintain a clean layout and a pleasant user experience, with easy navigation across pages. In the later stages, I focused on refining the layout using Flexbox and adding responsive design features so that the site would adapt well to different screen sizes.

                    <h3 class="report-h3">Design Decisions</h3>
                    <p>
                        In terms of design, I made color choice by trying out various colors and seeing which one is more appealing and fits the design I have in mind. The fonts were selected based on the look. I searche the internet for good fonts to use and came across "system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial,
                        sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji" ". I liked this font because this font has a very non serious attractive style which fits website and its contents very well. Regarding the colors, I chose mainly three colors. They are White, rgb(17, 24, 39) and #3be8b0. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       I chose these three color because of the contrast they give when used together. With the white background and the darker rgb(17, 24, 39) color , it is very easy to give contrast and the #3be8b0 color gives a perfect highlight to key elements in the page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not only the colors, but I have used multiple font sizes and font-weight for different elements to give a seperated look to the components that make a very appealing design. Font-size is big for titles and smaller for paragraphs, while for links they are medium.

                    <h3 class="report-h3">Validation and Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>
                        To ensure the site adhered to coding standards, I validated the HTML and CSS files using the W3C validation tools. The validation process was insightful, as it highlighted errors and warnings that I was able to correct. The screenshots of these validation reports are included in the appendix of this report, demonstrating that the HTML and CSS files are error-free and conform to industry standards.

                        A video demonstration of the site is available at [Media Space / YouTube URL]. In the video, I walk through the main features and functionalities of the website, providing a live demonstration of its responsiveness and user interface elements.
